name: Container Test

# Use jobs.<job_id>.container to create a container to run any steps in a job that don't already specify a container. 
# If you have steps that use both script and container actions, the container actions will run as sibling containers on the same network with the same volume mounts.
# When you only specify a container image, you can omit the image keyword.
#If you do not set a container, all steps will run directly on the host specified by runs-on unless a step refers to an action configured to run in a container.
