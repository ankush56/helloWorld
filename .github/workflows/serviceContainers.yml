#You can use service containers to 
#connect databases, web services, memory caches, and other tools to your workflow.
#GitHub creates a fresh Docker container for each service configured in the workflow, and destroys the service container when the job completes. 
#Steps in a job can communicate with all service containers that are part of the same job.
# For example, your workflow might need to run integration tests that require access to a database and memory cache.
# You can use the services keyword to create service containers that are part of a job in your workflow. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.services.

# Must run on Linux self hosted or ubuntu-latest on github hosted
#If your job runs in a Docker container, you do not need to map ports on the host or the service container. If your job runs directly on the runner machine,
#you'll need to map any required service container ports to ports on the host runner machine.

# Configuring jobs to run in a container simplifies networking configurations between the job and the service containers. Docker containers on the same user-defined bridge network expose all ports to each other, so you don't need to map any of the service container ports to the Docker host. 
# You can access the service container from the job container using the label you configure in the workflow.
